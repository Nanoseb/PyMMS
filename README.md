# PyMMS
This python module generates Manufactured Solutions for RANS equations using Sympy.

The following turbulence models have been implemented:
- Spalart-Allmaras (1992)
- One equation Eddy viscosity model from Menter (1997)

## Installation
Can be installed and used like any python package, for example:
```
pip3 install https://github.com/Nanoseb/PyMMS/archive/master.zip
```

## Usage
See examples folder:
- `basic_example.py`: a very basic test case to show how PyMMS can be used
- `3D_RANS_unsteady.py`: implementation of the Manufactured Solution defined in [Eca et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618562.2012.717617)
